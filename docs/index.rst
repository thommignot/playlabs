Playlabs: the obscene ansible distribution for shadow hackers & friends
=======================================================================

Playlabs provides a convenient wrapper for the ansible-playbook command and
provides a set of ansible roles made to work together, and to orchestrate
containers as much as possible and let only network level provisioning happen
on hosts themselves, and combines straigthforward ansible patterns to install a
docker orchestrated paas infra to prototype products for development to
small-size production.

Pre-beta state: works for me, but parts are being rewriten independently until
it's clean enough and declared stable, documentation is still in progress and
so are tests.
