Playlabs: the obscene ansible distribution.

Create your ssh user with your key and secure sshd (bootstrap):

    playlabs root@1.2.3.4
    # all options are ansible options are proxied
    playlabs @somehost --ask-become-pass 

Deploy roles that project depends on on the server:

    playlabs @somehost docker,firewall,nginx

Deploy a project:

    playlabs @somehost project \
        -e image=betagouv/mrs:master \
        -e plugins=postgres,django,uwsgi \
        -e backup_password=foo \
        -e '{"env":{"SECRET_KEY" :"itsnotasecret"}}

Initiate an inventory, for your users and projects configurations:

    playlabs init your-inventory
